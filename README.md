# File-System-Organiser

The script allows you to define a dictionary of file categories and their corresponding extensions. For instance, you can have a category for images, with extensions like jpeg, jpg, and png. Similarly, you can define categories for PDFs, datasets, and videos, with their respective extensions.

Once the categories and extensions are defined, the script will create subdirectories for each category in the main directory that youâ€™re monitoring. When a new file is added to the main directory, the script will classify the file based on its extension and move it to the corresponding subdirectory.
